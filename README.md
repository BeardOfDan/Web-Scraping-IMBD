This is a basic webscraper project. Since I am using it to refresh my memory on web scrapers, I am starting off by following the tutorial at https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js. I will then enhance the project at least a bit further (and probably refactor a few things).

NOTE: This project is console based, not browser based.
