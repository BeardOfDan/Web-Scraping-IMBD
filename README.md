This is a basic webscraper project. Since I am using it to refresh my memory on web scrapers, I am starting off by following the tutorial at https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js. I will then enhance the project at least a bit further (and probably refactor a few things).

It scrapes a particular IMDB page, based off of the title number, then it saves the data to the 'output' folder with the name of the title number and a json extension. Finally, it returns the json data in the response.
