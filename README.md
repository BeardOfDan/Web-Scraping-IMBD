This project scrapes a particular IMDB page, based off of the title number, then it saves the data to the 'output' folder with the name of the title number and a json extension. Finally, it returns the json data in the response.

The title number, for want of a better term, is the dynamic part of the IMDB url.
Example: To scrape info on the movie "The Endless", use tt3986820 as the title number.

Since I used this project to refresh my memory on web scrapers, I started off by following the tutorial at https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js. I then enhanced the project refactored a number of things.
